> A self-taught freelancer with more than 3 years of web development experience,
specializing in UX and UI design.
My work is inspired by a minimalist approach to design
with a focus on the most essential elements to match a
sleek premium look.
In my spare time, I indulge in my passion and enthusiasm for
cycling. Discipline and endurance are some of the attributes that seep through
my professional work as well.
